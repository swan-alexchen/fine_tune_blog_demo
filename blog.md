# Fine-Tuning Llama3 Models on Nebula Block GPU Instances with Unsloth: A Complete Guide

## Introduction

The landscape of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and the ability to create specialized, domain-specific AI models has become a competitive advantage across industries. While general-purpose language models like GPT-4 and Claude are impressive, they often lack the nuanced understanding required for specific business contexts, technical domains, or organizational workflows.

Fine-tuning large language models represents the bridge between generic AI capabilities and specialized expertise. It's the difference between having a knowledgeable generalist and a domain expert who speaks your language, understands your processes, and delivers precisely what you need.

This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to harness the power of Llama3 fine-tuning using two game-changing technologies: **Nebula Block's flexible GPU infrastructure** and **Unsloth's revolutionary optimization library**. Together, they make professional-grade model customization accessible, efficient, and cost-effective.

## Why Fine-Tune Language Models?

### The Specialization Imperative

Think of fine-tuning as the difference between hiring a general consultant versus a specialist who has spent years in your industry. While both are valuable, the specialist brings:

**Domain Expertise**: A fine-tuned model trained on medical literature doesn't just know about medicine—it understands medical terminology, diagnostic processes, and treatment protocols in context.

**Consistent Voice and Style**: Whether you're building a customer service bot or a technical documentation assistant, fine-tuning ensures your AI maintains your organization's tone, terminology, and communication standards.

**Proprietary Knowledge Integration**: Your internal processes, product specifications, and institutional knowledge can be embedded directly into the model, creating an AI that truly understands your business.

**Task-Specific Optimization**: Instead of a model that's decent at everything, you get one that excels at your specific use cases—whether that's generating code, writing marketing copy, or analyzing financial data.

### Real-World Impact

Consider these transformation scenarios:

- **Legal Firms**: A model fine-tuned on legal documents can draft contracts, analyze case law, and provide preliminary legal research with domain-appropriate language and structure.
- **Healthcare Organizations**: Fine-tuned models can assist with patient communication, medical documentation, and clinical decision support while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
- **Financial Services**: Models trained on financial data can provide investment analysis, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance guidance with industry-specific accuracy.
- **Software Companies**: Code-specific fine-tuning creates AI assistants that understand your codebase, coding standards, and architectural patterns.

|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Training Speed | 1x | 2x | 100% faster |
| Memory Usage | 100% | 50% | 50% reduction |
| GPU Requirements | A100 40GB | RTX 4090 24GB | Smaller, cheaper GPUs |
| Setup Complexity | High | Low | Simplified workflow |
| Cost per Training Run | $40-80 | $10-20 | 50-75% cost reduction |

This combination democratizes access to professional-grade fine-tuning, making it accessible to startups, research teams, and enterprises alike.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Nebula Block Account**: Sign up at [https://nebulablock.com/register](https://nebulablock.com/register) and receive $1 in free credits
2. **API Key**: Create one through the [customer portal](https://nebulablock.com/home) or via API
3. **SSH Key**: Upload your public SSH key for secure instance access
4. **Fine-tuning Dataset**: Prepared in chat/instruction format

## Step 1: Set Up Your Nebula Block Environment

### Create an API Key
```bash
curl -X POST '{API_URL}/api-keys' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "unsloth-llama3-key",
    "description": "API key for Llama3 fine-tuning with Unsloth"
  }'
```

### Upload SSH Key
```bash
curl -X POST '{API_URL}/ssh-keys' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN/KEY}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "key_name": "Unsloth Fine-tuning SSH Key",
    "key_data": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD5..."
  }'
```

## Step 2: Choose the Right GPU Instance

With Unsloth's memory optimizations, you can use smaller GPU instances:

- **Llama3-8B**: RTX 4090 (24GB) or RTX 3090 (24GB) - **Now sufficient with Unsloth!**
- **Llama3-70B**: Single A100 (40GB) or H100 (80GB) - **Previously required multiple GPUs**
- **Llama3-405B**: H100 (80GB) with gradient checkpointing

Check available products:
```bash
curl -X GET '{API_URL}/computing/products' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN/KEY}'
```

## Step 3: Launch Your GPU Instance

```bash
curl -X POST '{API_URL}/computing/instance' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN/KEY}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "instance_name": "unsloth-llama3-training",
    "product_id": "fcp66d566c43a9501001256",
    "image_id": "fcp66d566c93a95010012",
    "ssh_key_id": 2
  }'
```

## Step 4: Install Unsloth and Dependencies

Connect to your instance and set up the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/swan-alexchen/fine_tune_blog_demo.git
cd fine_tune_blog_demo

# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 5: Load and Configure the Model

Think of this step as **preparing your workspace and tools** before starting a complex project. Just like a carpenter needs the right tools and workspace setup, we need to configure our model properly for efficient fine-tuning.

### Why We Need Model Configuration

**Memory Management**: Large language models are like massive libraries with billions of books (parameters). Without proper organization, they won't fit in your computer's memory. 4-bit quantization is like creating a compressed catalog system - it reduces memory usage by 75% while keeping the essential information intact.

```python
# Configuration - Setting up our "workspace"
max_seq_length = 2048 # How long conversations we can handle (like setting table size)
dtype = None # Auto-detect the best number format for your hardware
load_in_4bit = True # Compress the model to fit in memory (like zip files)
```

**Model Loading**: This is like hiring an experienced teacher who already knows a lot, rather than training someone from scratch:

```python
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
    dtype = dtype,
    load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit,
)
```

### Why LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)?

**The Surgery Metaphor**: Instead of performing major surgery on the entire brain (full fine-tuning), LoRA is like installing small, specialized implants that enhance specific capabilities. We're not changing the core personality, just adding new skills.

LoRA targets specific "attention" modules - think of these as the model's focus mechanisms, like how you pay attention to different parts of a conversation.

```python
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r = 16, # Size of our "skill implants" - bigger = more capacity, more memory
    target_modules = ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
                      "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj",], # Which "brain regions" to enhance
    lora_alpha = 16, # How strongly to apply our new skills
    lora_dropout = 0, # Regularization (like practice variation)
    bias = "none",
    use_gradient_checkpointing = "unsloth", # Memory optimization trick
    random_state = 3407, # Ensures reproducible results
)
```

## Step 6: Configure Chat Template and Dataset

### Why Chat Templates Matter

**The Translation Problem**: Imagine you're teaching someone to have conversations, but they only understand a very specific format. Chat templates are like teaching the model the "grammar rules" of conversations - who speaks when, how to indicate turns, and how to format responses properly.

```python
from unsloth.chat_templates import get_chat_template

tokenizer = get_chat_template(
    tokenizer,
    chat_template = "chatml", # The "conversation grammar" we're teaching
    mapping = {"role" : "from", "content" : "value", "user" : "human", "assistant" : "gpt"}, # Translation dictionary
    map_eos_token = True, # How to say "conversation over"
)
```

### Why Dataset Formatting Is Crucial

**The Recipe Book Analogy**: Raw data is like having ingredients scattered everywhere. We need to organize them into a proper recipe book where each conversation follows the same format. This consistency helps the model learn patterns more effectively.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

def formatting_prompts_func(examples):
    # Convert messy conversations into clean, formatted "recipes"
    convos = examples["conversations"]
    texts = [tokenizer.apply_chat_template(convo, tokenize = False, add_generation_prompt = False) for convo in convos]
    return { "text" : texts, }

dataset = load_dataset("philschmid/guanaco-sharegpt-style", split = "train")
dataset = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched = True,)
```

## Step 7: Training Configuration and Execution

### Why These Training Settings Matter

**The Learning Process**: Think of this like setting up a study schedule for a student. Too fast (high learning rate) and they get overwhelmed; too slow and they never improve. We need the right balance of challenge and support.

```python
from trl import SFTTrainer
from transformers import TrainingArguments
from unsloth import is_bfloat16_supported

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    train_dataset = dataset,
    dataset_text_field = "text",
    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
    dataset_num_proc = 2,
    packing = False, # Whether to combine short examples (like study groups)
    args = TrainingArguments(
        per_device_train_batch_size = 2, # How many examples to study at once
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4, # Collect feedback before making changes
        warmup_steps = 5, # Gentle start, like warming up before exercise
        max_steps = 60, # Total number of learning iterations
        learning_rate = 2e-4, # How quickly to adapt (like study intensity)
        fp16 = not is_bfloat16_supported(), # Use efficient number formats
        bf16 = is_bfloat16_supported(),
        logging_steps = 1, # How often to check progress
        optim = "adamw_8bit", # The learning algorithm (like study method)
        weight_decay = 0.01, # Prevents over-memorization
        lr_scheduler_type = "linear", # Gradually reduce learning intensity
        seed = 3407, # Ensures reproducible results
        output_dir = "outputs",
        report_to = "none", # Where to log progress
    ),
)

trainer_stats = trainer.train() # Start the learning process!
```

**Key Training Concepts Explained**:
- **Batch Size**: Like study group size - too big and individual attention suffers, too small and learning is inefficient
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Like taking notes during multiple lectures before updating your understanding
- **Learning Rate**: The step size of improvement - like how much to adjust based on feedback
- **Warmup Steps**: Gentle introduction, like easing into a workout routine

## Step 8: Save the Fine-Tuned Model

### Why Saving Is Critical

**The Graduation Ceremony**: After all that training, we need to preserve what we've learned! This is like getting a diploma - proof of the new skills acquired.

```python
model.save_pretrained("blog_demo_lora")  # Save the new "skills" (LoRA adapters)
tokenizer.save_pretrained("blog_demo_lora") # Save the "language rules"
```

**What We're Actually Saving**:
- **LoRA Adapters**: The small "skill modules" we trained - these contain the new capabilities
- **Tokenizer**: The "dictionary" that translates between human language and model language
- **Configuration**: The "settings" that tell us how to use these components together

Think of it like saving a video game - you keep your character's new abilities and equipment, but the base game stays the same. This makes the saved model much smaller and easier to share than saving the entire massive model.

```


## Bringing Your Own Data for Custom Fine-Tuning

Now that you've seen how fine-tuning works with the demo dataset, let's explore how to prepare and use your own custom data to create domain-specific models tailored to your exact needs.

### Why Custom Data Matters

**From Generic to Specialized**: The demo showed you the mechanics, but custom data is where fine-tuning becomes powerful. Think of it like the difference between a general practitioner and a specialist doctor - both are valuable, but the specialist excels in their specific domain.

Custom datasets enable:
- **Domain Expertise**: Medical, legal, technical, or industry-specific knowledge
- **Brand Voice**: Consistent tone and style matching your organization
- **Specialized Tasks**: Customer support, code generation, content creation
- **Proprietary Knowledge**: Internal processes, products, or methodologies

### Choosing the Right Data Format

Different formats serve different purposes. Choose based on your end goal:

| Format | Best For | When to Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ShareGPT** | Conversational AI, chatbots | Building assistants, customer service |
| **Alpaca** | Task completion, instructions | Specific workflows, step-by-step guidance |
| **Raw Text** | Domain knowledge injection | Adding specialized vocabulary/concepts |

### ShareGPT Format: Building Conversational Experts

Perfect for creating domain-specific assistants:

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "from": "human",
      "value": "What's the difference between a 401k and a Roth IRA?"
    },
    {
      "from": "gpt",
      "value": "The key differences are: 1) Tax treatment - 401k contributions are pre-tax while Roth IRA contributions are post-tax..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Alpaca Format: Teaching Specific Tasks

Ideal for instruction-following and task completion:

```json
{
  "instruction": "Generate a Nebula Block API response for user authentication",
  "input": "User wants to authenticate with email: user@example.com",
  "output": "{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"message\": \"Authentication successful\",\n  \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\",\n  \"user_id\": \"12345\"\n}"
}
```

### Testing the Fine-Tuned Model

Here's the [`inference.py`](inference.py:1) script that loads and tests our fine-tuned model:

```python
from unsloth.chat_templates import get_chat_template
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

max_seq_length = 20480 # Choose any! We auto support RoPE Scaling internally!
dtype = None # None for auto detection. Float16 for Tesla T4, V100, Bfloat16 for Ampere+
load_in_4bit = True # Use 4bit quantization to reduce memory usage. Can be False.

# Load our fine-tuned model
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "blog_demo_own_dataset_lora", # Our saved model
    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
    dtype = dtype,
    load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit,
)

# Configure LoRA (same settings as training)
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r = 16,
    target_modules = ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
                      "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj",],
    lora_alpha = 16,
    lora_dropout = 0,
    bias = "none",
    use_gradient_checkpointing = "unsloth",
    random_state = 3407,
    use_rslora = False,
    loftq_config = None,
)

# Set up chat template
tokenizer = get_chat_template(
    tokenizer,
    chat_template = "chatml",
    mapping = {"role" : "from", "content" : "value", "user" : "human", "assistant" : "gpt"},
    map_eos_token = True,
)

# Enable fast inference
FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)

# Test the model with a Nebula Block API question
messages = [
    {"from": "human", "value": "write me a python script to get all the ssh keys from nebula block:"},
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize = True,
    add_generation_prompt = True,
    return_tensors = "pt",
).to("cuda")

from transformers import TextStreamer
text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)
_ = model.generate(input_ids = inputs, streamer = text_streamer, max_new_tokens = 1280, use_cache = True)
```

### Impressive Results: Domain-Specific Expertise

When we ask our fine-tuned model about Nebula Block's SSH keys API, it provides a perfect, production-ready response:

**Question**: "write me a python script to get all the ssh keys from nebula block:"

**Model Response**:
```python
import requests
import os

API_URL = "https://api.nebulablock.com/api/v1"
NEBULA_API_KEY = os.environ.get("NEBULA_API_KEY")

headers = {
   "Content-Type": "application/json",
   "Authorization": f"Bearer {NEBULA_API_KEY}"
}

response = requests.get(f'{API_URL}/ssh-keys', headers=headers)

if response.json().get("status") == "success":
   ssh_keys = response.json().get("data", [])
   print(f"Your SSH Keys:")
   for key in ssh_keys:
       print(f"  Name: {key['key_name']}, ID: {key['id']}, Public Key: {key['public_key']}")
else:
   print(f"Failed to retrieve SSH keys: {response.json().get('message')}")
```

### What Makes This Response Remarkable

**1. Perfect API Knowledge**: The model correctly uses:
- The exact Nebula Block API endpoint (`/ssh-keys`)
- Proper authentication headers with Bearer token
- Correct response structure parsing

**2. Production-Ready Code**: Includes:
- Environment variable usage for API keys
- Error handling for failed requests
- Clean, formatted output
- Proper JSON response parsing

**3. Domain-Specific Understanding**: The model learned:
- Nebula Block's specific API patterns
- Expected response formats
- Best practices for API interaction

This demonstrates how fine-tuning with domain-specific data creates models that understand your exact use case, API structure, and business context - something impossible with generic models.
